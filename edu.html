        <h3>PROJECTS</h3><hr>
        <b>A Low Power High Speed Accuracy Controllable Approximate 8*8 Multiplier Design</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Proposed technique divides the multiplicand & multiplier into two halves based on the significance as lower order and higher order.</li>
            <li>The proposed multiplier architecture uses four-stage structures to get final output such as partial product generation, barrel shifter, carry propagator and generator and accurate adder.</li>
            <li>Applications where speed and low power consumption are critical and make use of this design:<br>
                1. Digital Signal Processing (DSP): Enhances audio/video processing efficiency.<br>
                2. Machine Learning: Accelerates matrix multiplications in neural networks.<br>
                3. Embedded Systems: Extends battery life in IoT devices. </li>
            <li>Cost Reduction: By optimizing for lower power and simpler designs, overall manufacturing and operational costs can be reduced, particularly in large-scale deployments.</li>
        </ul>
